- title: Why Merch?
  description: Turn your employees into ambassadors, and your customers into loyal
    fans
  summary: "One of the greatest ways to imprint your product in the minds of your
    stakeholders is through promotional products. As opposed to agressive advertising,
    people seeing your merch around creates an unconcious impression in their mind.
    \nApart from merch being a way of appreciating your customers and converting them
    into loyal fans, it also makes them your foot soldiers.\nMerch is one of the best
    ways to affect consumer behaviors, so everytime you think about what to do to
    scale your business and get a brand presence, think merch, and most importantly
    think Wii."
